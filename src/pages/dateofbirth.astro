		I started off by creating a truth table for my birthday. This allowed me to 
		figure out each input for my seven-segment displays. I did mess this up, as I 
		realized later in the project when some of the displays weren't turning on at 
		the right times, but I went back in and fixed it. I then moved on to creating a 
		K-map for each of the displays, and created the simplified boolean expressions 
		for each of the seven-segment display inputs. Then, I mapped out the circuits in 
		AOI form, which allowed me to see which gates I could simplify into XNOR and NOR. 
		I built my simplified circuits in Multisim, using bus lines which made everything 
		very simple. After creating the digital circuit, we constructed it in person on a 
		breadboard!
